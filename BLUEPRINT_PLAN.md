# RepoLens: Strategic Roadmap

**Core Vision**: Surpass CodeWiki by transitioning from a documentation reader to an **Interactive Architectural Operating System**.

---

### MILESTONE_01: SYSTEM_INTELLIGENCE (COMPLETE)
- [x] **SystemAnalyzer**: Automated parsing of CI/CD, Makefiles, and build scripts.
- [x] **Pattern Recognition**: Native detection of Zustand, Radix, Tailwind, and NestJS.
- [x] **Monotone UI**: Purge of all informal design elements and emojis.

### MILESTONE_02: DYNAMIC_EXECUTION (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Native Sandbox**: Docker-based secure runtime for code verification on EC2.
- [x] **Interactive Wiki**: Click-to-run code snippets and Mermaid.js diagrams.
- [x] **Vaulting Protocol**: Manual bookmarking of verified architectures.

### MILESTONE_03: PROCESS_DEPTH (IN_PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Script Content Extraction**: Enhance worker to read build/infra script logic.
- [ ] **Functional Logic Mapping**: AI explains *how* scripts work by analyzing code.

### MILESTONE_04: SPATIAL_MAP_V2 (IN_PROGRESS)
- [x] **ReactFlow 2D Engine**: High-performance spatial navigation installed.
- [ ] **Semantic Hotspots**: Mapping risk scores directly to the 2D nodes.

### MILESTONE_05: OXIDIZED_CORE (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Rust Migration**: Rebuilding the Python worker in Rust for 100x speed.
- [ ] **OXC Integration**: Replacing Tree-sitter with the ultra-fast OXC parser.
- [ ] **SCIP Protocol**: Implementing symbolic indexing for exact code navigation.
- [ ] **Multi-Threaded Indexing**: Support for repositories with 1M+ lines of code.

### ARCHITECTURAL_NORTH_STAR
Transition to a **Self-Healing Repository**. RepoLens should not only explain the code but suggest refactors and generate missing tests by running them in the native sandbox to verify success before proposing a PR.
