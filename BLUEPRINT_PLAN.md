# RepoLens: Strategic Roadmap

**Core Vision**: Surpass CodeWiki by transitioning from a documentation reader to an **Interactive Architectural Operating System**.

---

### MILESTONE_01: SYSTEM_INTELLIGENCE (COMPLETE)
- [x] **SystemAnalyzer**: Automated parsing of CI/CD, Makefiles, and build scripts.
- [x] **Pattern Recognition**: Native detection of Zustand, Radix, Tailwind, and NestJS.
- [x] **Monotone UI**: Purge of all informal design elements and emojis.

### MILESTONE_02: DYNAMIC_EXECUTION (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Native Sandbox**: Docker-based secure runtime for code verification on EC2.
- [x] **Interactive Wiki**: Click-to-run code snippets and Mermaid.js diagrams.
- [x] **Vaulting Protocol**: Manual bookmarking of verified architectures.

### MILESTONE_03: PROCESS_DEPTH (IN_PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Script Content Extraction**: Enhance the worker to read the first 100 lines of identified build/infra scripts.
- [ ] **Functional Logic Mapping**: AI explains *how* scripts work by analyzing the code inside them.
- [ ] **Multi-Pass Inference**: Implement a second AI pass to link CLI tools to core registry logic.

### MILESTONE_04: REPOSITORY_SYNC (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Incremental Indexing**: Detect changes in GitHub repos and update the archive automatically.
- [ ] **Diff Reports**: Show how architecture has drifted between two scan versions.
- [ ] **Webhooks**: Automatic re-analysis triggered by Git Push events.

### ARCHITECTURAL_NORTH_STAR
Transition to a **Self-Healing Repository**. RepoLens should not only explain the code but suggest refactors and generate missing tests by running them in the native sandbox to verify success before proposing a PR.
