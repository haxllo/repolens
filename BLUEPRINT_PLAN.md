# RepoLens: Living Roadmap (The "CodeWiki" Pivot)

**Core Vision:** Transform RepoLens from a static analysis tool into an **Interactive, AI-Powered Operating System for Codebases**.
**North Star:** Surpass the capabilities of "CodeWiki" by adding deep system intelligence, live code execution, and architectural pattern recognition.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: System Intelligence (Status: COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Understand the "How" (Workflows/Infra), not just the "What" (Code).

- [x] **SystemAnalyzer**: Parse `scripts`, `Makefile`, `.github/workflows`.
- [x] **Orchestrator Integration**: Inject system data into the AI context.
- [x] **Context-Aware Prompt**: AI writes "Development Workflow" & "Infrastructure" chapters.
- [x] **Pattern Recognition**: Detect Zustand, Radix, Tailwind, and NestJS patterns in AST.

## ⚡ Phase 2: Live Execution & Media (Status: COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Allow users to verify code and visualize architecture instantly.

- [x] **SandboxService**: Judge0 API integration for secure, multi-language code execution.
- [x] **Wiki Image Engine**: Click-to-zoom images with technical captions.
- [x] **Mermaid.js Integration**: Live rendering of flowcharts and sequence diagrams.
- [x] **Premium Editorial UI**: High-end typography and choreographed motion design.

## 🧠 Phase 3: Deep Process Analysis (Status: PLANNED)
**Goal:** Reach 100% parity with "Master Manuals" by analyzing script logic.

- [ ] **Script Content Extractor**: Read the first 100 lines of identified build/infra scripts.
- [ ] **Dependency Deep-Dive**: Identify exactly how CLI tools interact with core registries.
- [ ] **Multi-Pass Reasoning**: AI first maps the system, then writes the manual based on the map.

## 🗺️ Phase 4: The Architectural Blueprint (Status: IN PROGRESS)
**Goal:** Replace the chaotic 3D sphere with a structured, engineer-friendly map.

- [x] **ReactFlow Core**: High-performance 2D canvas installed.
- [x] **Auto-Layout Engine**: Hierarchical ranking using Dagre.
- [x] **Blueprint Nodes**: Technical schematic cards with risk indicators.
- [ ] **Interactive Overlays**: Toggle "Risk Heatmap" and "Data Flow" directly on the graph.

## 🧠 Phase 5: The "Second Brain" (Status: RESEARCH)
**Goal:** Personalized AI that learns your specific coding style.

- [x] **Vector Database**: Cloudflare Vectorize integration for semantic code indexing.
- [ ] **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieval-augmented generation for repository-wide Q&A.
- [ ] **User Context**: Train models on user-specific PR history and coding tone.

## 📈 Current Focus: Phase 3 (Deep Process Analysis)
**Objective:** Enhance the Python worker to read script contents so the AI can explain *how* they work, not just that they exist.
