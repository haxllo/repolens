# RepoLens: Strategic Roadmap

**Core Vision**: Surpass CodeWiki by transitioning from a documentation reader to an **Interactive Architectural Operating System**.

---

### MILESTONE_01: SYSTEM_INTELLIGENCE (COMPLETE)
- [x] **SystemAnalyzer**: Automated parsing of CI/CD, Makefiles, and build scripts.
- [x] **Pattern Recognition**: Native detection of Zustand, Radix, Tailwind, and NestJS.
- [x] **Accessibility Integration**: Implementation of WCAG AA standards across all components.

### MILESTONE_02: DYNAMIC_EXECUTION (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Native Sandbox**: Docker-based secure runtime for code verification on EC2.
- [x] **Interactive Wiki**: Click-to-run code snippets and Mermaid.js diagrams.
- [x] **Vaulting Protocol**: Manual bookmarking of verified architectures.

### MILESTONE_03: PROCESS_DEPTH (IN_PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Script Content Extraction**: Enhance worker to read build/infra script logic.
- [ ] **Functional Logic Mapping**: AI explains *how* scripts work by analyzing code.

### MILESTONE_04: SPATIAL_MAP_V2 (IN_PROGRESS)
- [x] **ReactFlow 2D Engine**: High-performance spatial navigation installed.
- [ ] **Semantic Hotspots**: Mapping risk scores directly to the 2D nodes.

### MILESTONE_05: OXIDIZED_CORE (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] **Rust Migration**: Initial setup of oxc-based scanner in `apps/oxidizer`.
- [x] **SCIP Protocol**: Symbolic indexing for JS/TS definitions and references.
- [ ] **OXC Integration**: Replacing Tree-sitter with the ultra-fast OXC parser for all languages.
- [ ] **Multi-Threaded Indexing**: Support for repositories with 1M+ lines of code.

### MILESTONE_06: HYBRID_INTELLIGENCE // ARCHIVE_CORE (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Phase 1: Local Embeddings**: Integrated local Hugging Face `sentence-transformers` for zero-cost indexing.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Multi-Stage Synthesis**: Breaking Wiki generation into specialized stages (Data Mapping, Visual Logic, Strategic Narrative).
- [ ] **Phase 3: Deep Symbolic Wiki**: Using SCIP data to generate precise "Symbol Tables" mapping architecture.

### ARCHITECTURAL_NORTH_STAR
Transition to a **Self-Healing Repository**. RepoLens should not only explain the code but suggest refactors and generate missing tests by running them in the native sandbox to verify success before proposing a PR.
